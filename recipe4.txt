Vegan Sabich Sandwich
This vegan sabich sandwich is a twist on the traditional Israeli sandwich using white beans instead of egg.

Ingredients
pita bread pockets
2 medium firm potatoes peeled and boiled.
1 medium young eggplant
heaped 1/2 cup canned white beans drained and rinsed well
1 tablespoon vegan or regular mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon harissa paste
3 whole dill pickles 1 per pita
hummus around 1/2 cup for 3 pitas
tabbouleh salad around 1/2 cup for 3 pitas
tahini sauce 1/3 cup for 3 pittas (optional)
sea salt
olive oil

Instructions
Chop eggplant in to 1cm cubes.
Heat a small fry pan and a good lug of olive oil.
Season the eggplant with sea salt and cook on low-medium heat until slightly creamy but still holding it's shape. Test to make sure they are not still woody. Continue to cook if needed.
Remove from the heat and set aside.
Slice the boiled potatoes in to 1/2 cm thick slices.
In a small mixing bowl combine the white beans, mayonnaise and harissa paste.
Slice the dill pickles in to vertical slices around 1/2 cm thick.
Lay the pitas out to build the sabich sandwich.
Smear a good amount of hummus on to each bread.
Cover half the pita with a layer of sliced potato.
Lay sliced pickle over the potato using 1 whole pickle per sandwich
Spoon 2 tablespoons of white bean mix on to the pickle.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of cooked eggplant.
Spoon 2 heaped tablespoons of the tabbouleh.
Drizzle with tahini sauce (linked recipe in the body of this post). Add more harissa if you like hot.
Fold the pita in half and serve.
