Pumpkin and Kale Steel Cut Oats

A new take on the traditional breakfast grain, this savoury steel-cut oatmeal combines pumpkin and kale for a delicious and nutritious meal for anytime of the day.

Ingredients:
1 shallot, peeled and minced
1 small garlic clove, peeled and minced
1 cup vegetable stock
1 cup water
½ cup Nature’s Path Organic Steel Cut Oats
½ cup pumpkin puree
½ tsp dried thyme
¼ tsp ground black pepper
¼ tsp sea salt
½ cup chopped kale

Directions:
Combine the shallot and garlic in a small saucepan with a splash of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the vegetable stock and water and bring to a boil. Stir in the oats. When oats begin to thicken (about 5 minutes), reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 25 minutes, or until desired consistency is achieved.
Stir in the pumpkin puree, thyme, pepper, and salt, then stir in the kale. Remove from heat and scoop into a large bowl or divide into two small bowls. Serve immediately.
